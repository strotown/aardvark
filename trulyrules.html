Prize winner will be selected on or around 7/1/2023 from all eligible entries received during the Contest Period.</p>
    <p><strong>HOW TO ENTER:</strong></p>
    <p>There is one (1) way to enter:</p>
    <p>During the contest period: Snap a photo via the filter. Post to Instagram with the hashtag #TRUSUMMER and your response to the following question: Tell us about a Truly unique summer trip you’d like to take with Tru by Hilton. Where would you go, who would you take, what would you do?</p>
    <p>Limited one (1) entry per person, regardless of method of entry. Duplicate entries for a single individual will be disqualified.  All entries become the property of the Sponsor.</p>
    <p><strong>JUDGING: Entrants will be judged by the Tru by Hilton team based on the following criteria:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>The quality and uniqueness of the entry (answer and photo will be judged)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Entrants will be judged by the Tru by Hilton team, whose decisions as to the administration and operation of the contest and the selection of the potential winners are final and binding in all matters related to the Contest. All entries will be judged equally on the quality and uniqueness of their entry.</p>
    <p>Judging the quality and creativity of a photo is subjective, but there are some general criteria that can be used to evaluate a photograph:<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Answer to the Question: The uniqueness, relevance and creativity used to answer the question.</li>
        <li>Use of the Hashtag: Inclusion of the Promotional Hashtag #TRUSUMMER (Required).</li>
        <li>Composition: The way the elements in the photo are arranged and how they interact with each other can greatly affect the overall impact of the photo. A well-composed photo will have a pleasing balance and harmony between the different elements.</li>
        <li>Exposure: Exposure refers to how bright or dark a photo is. A good photo should have the right exposure for the subject matter, with the right balance of light and shadow.</li>
        <li>Focus: The focus of a photo can draw the viewer's attention to a particular subject or detail. A well-focused photo will have the subject in sharp focus, while the background is blurred.</li>
        <li>Color: The use of color in a photo can greatly affect the mood and tone of the image. A good photo will have colors that are balanced and harmonious.</li>
        <li>Creativity: A creative photo will have a unique and interesting perspective, composition, or subject matter that sets it apart from other photos.</li>
        <li>Storytelling: A photo that tells a story or evokes an emotion can be particularly impactful. A good photo should be able to convey a message or tell a story without the need for words.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These are just a few criteria, and there are many other factors that can affect the quality and creativity of a photo. Ultimately, what makes a photo "good" is subjective and depends on the judge’s own unique taste and preferences. The winning entry will be solely based upon these distinct tastes & preferences and will not be subject to any outside opinions of definitions of the above description.</p>
